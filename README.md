# pyside2-wheels

The aim of this project was to build PySide2 wheels on multiple platforms before official, portable wheels were offered by [The Qt Company](https://www.qt.io).

This project is now archived and will no longer be maintained, as The Qt Company [is under way](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-558) to distribute their own pip-installable and portable wheels. Also, PySide2 can be easily installed [with `conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/pyside2-feedstock).

The wheels built for this project will be removed once official wheels are published by The Qt Company.
