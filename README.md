# pyside2-wheels

The aim of the pyside2-wheels project was to build PySide2 wheels on multiple platforms before official, portable wheels were offered by [The Qt Company](https://www.qt.io). The project was abandoned when PySide2 became installable via [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/pyside2-feedstock), making it widely available without having to build PySide2 from source. Shortly thereafter, The Qt Company announced [it is under way](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-558) to distribute their own pip-installable and portable wheels. Unfortunately, this still hasn't happened, and the need for standalone wheels still exist, and so I decided to open up three separate new projects (links at the top) to address this.

The old and abandoned pyside2-wheels project is now archived and will no longer be maintained.
The wheels built for the pyside2-wheels project will be removed once official wheels are published by The Qt Company.
